                <p>
                    I am a graphic and interface designer with over ten years experience in
                    web design and authoring, alongside print and animation creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked within the UK and Australia at communications studios and
                    web-based software houses creating agile solutions for telecoms, health
                    and media sectors.

                    From an early age I strove to simplify stuff through design. Being a child
                    of the 80s, technology was never graceful. My frustration codified my need
                    to find ways to explain and clarify processes. This materialised properly
                    through the joy of interface design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At times Iâ€™m obsessed with function, order and balance. Drawer tidying
                    can be addictive! Whilst other moments are consumed by creative, fluffy
                    thinking, copy-writing and puns...
