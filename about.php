                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            I am a graphic and interface designer with over ten years experience in
                            web design and authoring, alongside print and animation creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have worked within the UK and Australia at communications studios and
                            web-based software houses creating agile solutions for telecoms, health
                            and media sectors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From an early age I strove to simplify stuff through design. Being a child
                            of the 80s, technology was never graceful. My frustration codified my need
                            to find ways to explain and clarify processes. This materialised properly
                            through the joy of interface design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At times Iâ€™m obsessed with function, order and balance. Drawer tidying
                            can be addictive! Whilst other moments are consumed by creative, fluffy
                            thinking, copy-writing and puns...
                        </p>
